##Daily process
• Morning & afternoon standups cover progress made, current tasks, blockers/obstacles  
• Don’t hesitate to ask questions if stuck OR not sure about strategy  
• IF you happen to be stuck, send out a ticket to the Slack channel and see who responds  
• Bring up any blocking issues after 30 minutes of spinning your wheels  
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

##Git etiquette
• Only solid code to Master  
• All working branches off of Development  
• Create targeted branches  
• Messages: start -m with sub-topic you're working on + : (ie. "design: nav bar css")  
• ALWAYS pull from currend Dev branch and correct issues before submitting pull requests.

##Team expectations
• While we're all expected to give 100%, we each reserve the right to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project  
• If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought  
• We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally) - the slice structure of develpment  
• None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Share the mic  
• Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently  
• You can only work on user stories that are assigned to you  
• No ratholes - While working as a group on high-level objectives, try not to get bogged down in very small details that can waste time for other people in the group

##Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:  
• Vote on it  
• If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor  

If you are frustrated
• Take a walk or get some water  
• Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)  
• Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
